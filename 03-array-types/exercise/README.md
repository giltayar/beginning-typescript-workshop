# Exercise 03

- Run `cd 03-array-types` to go into the folder
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Open `exercise/split-words.ts` in the editor. This is TypeScript code that is not typed.
- Open two terminals side by side:
  - In the first, run `npm run build`
  - In the second, run `node dist/exercise/split-words.js`
- Verify that you indeed get type errors
- Type _all_ the parameters and variable in the code
-Verify now that it has no errors and outputs the correct value
